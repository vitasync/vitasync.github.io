    tax code, NI letter, pension settings, overtime and holiday entries,
    bonuses, and after-tax deductions.
  </p>

  <h3>b. Device-Generated Data</h3>
  <p>
    We use Google Firebase services which may collect limited technical data:
    crash logs (Firebase Crashlytics), app instance IDs, device information,
    and optional analytics events (Firebase Analytics).
  </p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>

  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>
    Your personal financial and shift data is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>.
    We do not receive this data unless you choose to export or share it.
    Crash and analytics data is processed by Google Firebase and stored on their servers.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell or rent your personal information.
    Data may be shared only with service providers (currently Google Firebase)
    for diagnostics and analytics purposes, as described above.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Holidays & Overtime</h2>
  <p>
    Holiday and overtime entries are saved locally.
    Totals and reports are calculated on-device and shown only to you.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    ShiftPay is not directed to children under 13,
    or the minimum age required in your country.
