    Effective date: <strong>17 January 2026</strong> • Developer: VitaSync Labs —

  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

  <h3>a. User-Provided Data</h3>
  <p>
    When you use ShiftPay, you may choose to enter information such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Shift times and patterns</li>

    <li>Pay rates, premiums, and multipliers</li>
    <li>Contracted hours and schedules</li>
    <li>Optional notes and work history details</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>b. Shared Holiday Data (Optional Feature)</h3>
  <p>
    If you enable the <strong>shared holidays</strong> feature, limited holiday-related
    information is uploaded to Google Firebase so it can be shared across devices
    or with selected users.
  </p>
  <p>This data may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Holiday dates</li>
    <li>Holiday type (for example: leave or time off)</li>
    <li>A non-identifying shared reference ID</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>No pay data, shift details, notes, or personal identifiers are shared.</strong>
    Shared holiday data is uploaded only when you actively use this feature.
  </p>

  <h3>c. Device-Generated Data</h3>
  <p>
    ShiftPay uses Google Firebase services which may collect limited technical data,
    including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Crash logs (Firebase Crashlytics)</li>
    <li>App instance identifiers</li>
    <li>Device and operating system information</li>
    <li>Optional, anonymised analytics events (Firebase Analytics, if enabled)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This data does <strong>not</strong> include your personal shift, pay, or holiday records.
  </p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Calculate and display shifts, overtime, holidays, and totals</li>
    <li>Synchronise shared holiday entries when the feature is enabled</li>
    <li>Display summaries, history, and reports in the app</li>
    <li>Improve app stability and performance</li>
    <li>Diagnose and fix technical problems</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>
    Shift, overtime, and pay data is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>.
    Shared holiday data is stored securely in Firebase only when the feature is enabled.
    VitaSync Labs does not access your personal pay or shift history.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information.

        crash diagnostics, and optional analytics</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    No employers, advertisers, or other third parties have access to your data.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Holidays & Overtime</h2>
  <p>
    Overtime entries are always stored locally on your device.
    Holiday entries are stored locally unless you enable shared holidays.
    All calculations and reports are performed on-device.
  </p>

    ShiftPay is not intended for children under 13,
    or under the minimum age required in your country.
    We do not knowingly collect data from children.

    <li>Crash diagnostics are processed under legitimate interests</li>
    <li>Analytics are collected only where consent is required and provided</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    California residents may exercise rights under the CCPA where applicable.
